`v0.7.0`_ - 2020-03-27
----------------------

*PlotOptiX has moved to OptiX 7 framework in this version.* This is a major change, basically a rewrite of entire
ray-tracting engine, followed by several breaking changes in the Python API. Denoiser binaries included in GPU
driver and improved compilation of shaders code are among advantages of the new framework. The long lasting issues
with using PlotOptiX on some hardware configurations, related to the shader compilation should be resolved now.

OptiX 7 shifts significant parts of functionality to the application side. Multi-GPU support and most of the
ray-tracting host state is now maintained by PlotOptiX code. Be warned that this code is fresh! If you spot
problems, go ahead and submit issue to the tracker on GitHub.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- no need to install denoiser binaries separately, no OptiX binaries shipped with PlotOptiX package (these libraries
  are now included in the GPU driver)
- setup_denoiser() removed, denoising is now configured with add_postproc() method
- uniform configuration of textures used by materials, geometries, background, etc., see load_texture() and
  set_texture_2d() methods
- material textures are now referenced by texture name instead of full texture description included in the
  material definition
- some of material properties names changed, see updated pre-defined materials
- NormalTilt removed from GeomAttributeProgram, surface normals are modulated with material textures
- tonal correction parameter tonemap_igamma (inverse value of gamma) changed to tonemap_gamma (gamma value)
- JSON structure changed and not backward-compatible for several scene components, which means scenes saved
  with earlier releases wont load with v0.7.0

Added
~~~~~

- surface roughness textures
- load_texture() method to facilitate reading textures from file

`v0.5.2`_ - 2019-10-15
----------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- dependency on vcruntime140_1.dll in Windows binaries, introduced in v0.5.1 with the VS tools upgrade 

`v0.5.1`_ - 2019-09-27
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- ray tracing timeout parameter, use set_param(rt_timeout=n_ms) and get_param("rt_timeout")

Fixed
~~~~~

- timeout instead of freeze if stucked in the internal OptiX launch() function
- default lighting was not initialized properly after refactoring made in v0.5.0

`v0.5.0`_ - 2019-09-20
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- scene saving/loading in JSON file format or python's dictionary (note, format is not finally freezed and may
  change on migration to OptiX 7)
- callbacks re-configurable after initialization
- load selected/all/merged objects from Wavefront .obj files
- thin-walled material

Changes
~~~~~~~

- load_mesh_obj() method renamed to load_merged_mesh_obj(); the new load_mesh_obj() loads meshes selected by
  the name or loads all meshes from the file with no merging
- light shading mode configured with set_param() and get_param() methods

`v0.4.8`_ - 2019-09-07
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Oren-Nayar diffuse reflectance model (in addition to the default Lambertian), adjustable surface roughness
- adjustable surface rougness also for metalic and dielectric (glass) materials, improved predefined materials

Changes
~~~~~~~

- metalic and mirror materials use primitive colors to colorize the reflection (primitive color overrides
  surface albedo) so color data can be effectively used also with these materials

`v0.4.7`_ - 2019-08-28
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- select and rotate/move/scale objects and lights in GUI with mouse (same as for the camera)
- status bar in GUI, shows selected item, 2D/3D coordinates of the surface under the pointer, and FPS
- method to set fixed size of the ray-tracing output in GUI (or go back to auto-fit to window size)

`v0.4.6`_ - 2019-08-19
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- methods to rotate camera about given point, eye about target, target about eye, in local and global coordinates

Changes
~~~~~~~

- calculate normal tilt on the fly in the surface displacement mode, speed not affected, much lower gpu memory footprint

Fixed
~~~~~

- normal tilt mode in textured parallelepipeds bug resulting with transparent walls in some configs

`v0.4.5`_ - 2019-08-11
----------------------

Added

- overlay a texture in 2D postprocessing

`v0.4.2`_ - 2019-07-23
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- method to get light source parameters in a dictionary
- examples installer - so examples compatible with the recent PyPI release can be downloaded locally without cloning the repository

Fixed
~~~~~

`v0.4.1`_ - 2019-07-14
----------------------

Added
~~~~~

- 2D color preprocessing utility
